  ## Control of the activity of CAR-T cells within tumours via focused ultrasound
---
Liu L, He P, Wang Y et al. screened the heat-shock promoters, which can be activated by focused ultrasound (FUS), to drive the expression of the chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) in T cells. A highly active FUS-responsive heatshock promoter was identified to control the CAR expression within tumours specifically. Such an approach reduces the off-tumour toxicity.

Another spotlight for this study is the combination of different signalling cascades added to the CAR, reinforcing the activity of the T cells. For instance, the mini-promoters of human interleukin 2 (IL2), necrosis factor kappa B (NF-κB), nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT) and YB-TATA.

<h3>Questions to be addressed</h3>
1. Why are CD8+ T cells, rather than CD4+ T cells, preferentially enriched in the EchoBack-CAR system compared with standard CAR T cells?
2. How is the safety profile of the EchoBack-CAR system in more biomimetic models?
