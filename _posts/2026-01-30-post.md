  Control of the activity of CAR-T cells within tumours via focused ultrasound
---
Heat-shock promoters, which can be activated by focused ultrasound, were used to drive the expression of the chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) in T cells. Therefore, the CAR only expressed within tumours under control.

Another spotlight for this study is the combination of different signalling cascades added to the CAR, reinforcing the activity of the T cells. For instance, the mini-promoters of human interleukin 2 (IL2), necrosis factor kappa B (NF-κB), nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT) and YB-TATA.
