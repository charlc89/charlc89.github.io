<ul class="padded-list">
  <li>Macrophage: Eliminate pathogens by phagocytosis and present antigens to helper T cells </li>
  <li>Helper T-cell: Activates killer T cells and B cells </li>
  <li>Killer T cell: Kill pathogen-infected cells or cancer cells  </li>
  <li>B cell: Produce antibodies that recognise the pathogen</li>
  <li>Dendritic cell: Present antigens to helper T cells</li>
  <li>Neutrophil: Eliminate pathogens by phagocytosis at the first line</li>
  <li>Basophil: Release inflammatory cytokines</li>
  <li>Eosinophil: Response to parasitic infection</li>
</ul>
