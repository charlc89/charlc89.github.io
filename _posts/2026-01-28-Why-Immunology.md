The study of immunology is fascinating.

Every immune cell plays a role in the body, like an orchestra:

<ul>
  <li>Macrophage: Eliminate pathogens by phagocytosis and present antigens to helper T cells </li>
  <li>Helper T-cell: Activates killer T cells and B cells </li>
  <li>Killer T cell: Kill pahtogen-infected cells or cancer cells  </li>
  <li>B cell: Produce antibodies that recognise the pathogen</li>
  <li>Dendritic cell: Present antigens to helper T cells</li>
</ul>
