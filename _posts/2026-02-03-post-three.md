Hosking MP et al. engineered the iPSC-derived CAR T cells with multi-gene insertions to overcome the repressive tumour microenvironments in breast cancers. A specific CAR was designed to target the truncated HER2 receptor, which is observed in breast cancer, rather than the native HER2 receptor in normal tissue.

Due to the self-renewal ability of iPSC, multiple genes can be introduced into the cells and then differentiated into T cells to overcome the short lifetime of primary T cells ex vivo.

The following genes were knocked into the T cell receptor alpha (TRAC) and CD38 loci of iPSC to improve the persistence of the T cells in the tumour microenvironment:
<ul>
  <li>A high affinity non-cleavable CD16a: a Fc receptor commonly expressed in NK cells for ADCC-enabled monoclonal antibodies with multi-antigen targeting</li>
  <li>TGF-βR2-IL18R: resistent to TGF-β repression</li>
  <li>CXCR2: solid tumour trafficking</li>
  <li>IL7R fusion: improve iPSC-derived CAR-T cells persistence</li>
</ul>
<h3>Questions to be addressed</h3>
1. How does the multiplex engineering of H2-7E iT cells impact their long-term persistence and anti-tumour efficacy in vivo?
2. How can the engineering of additional chemokine receptors further enhance the trafficking of H2-7E iT cells to solid tumors?
3. What strategies can be employed to monitor and mitigate potential adverse effects associated with H2-7E iT therapy?
