Hosking MP et al. engineered the iPSC-derived CAR T cells with multi-gene insertion to overcome the repressive tumour microenvironments in breast cancers.

The following genes were knocked into the T cell receptor alpha (TRAC) and CD38 loci of iPSC:
<ul>
  <li>A high affinity non-cleavable CD16a: multi-gene targeting with ADCC-enabled monoclonal antibodies</li>
  <li>TGF-βR2-IL18R: resistent to TGF-β repression</li>
  <li>CXCR2: solid tumour trafficking</li>
  <li>IL7R fusion: improve iPSC-derived CAR-T cells persistence</li>
</ul>
<h3>Questions to be addressed</h3>
1. How does the multiplex engineering of H2-7E iT cells impact their long-term persistence and anti-tumour efficacy in vivo?
2. How can the engineering of additional chemokine receptors further enhance the trafficking of H2-7E iT cells to solid tumors?
3. What strategies can be employed to monitor and mitigate potential adverse effects associated with H2-7E iT therapy?
